# Leaflet Challenge
This project highlights the following technical skills:
* JavaScript
* Leaflet.js
* D3.js
* HTML/CSS
* GeoJSON
* Data Visualization
* API Requests
* Responsive Design

## Objective
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Data
GeoJSON data from USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. All Earthquakes from the past 7 days. Data updated every minute. Accessed 11/09/2023.

### Technologies Used
* Leaflet.js
* D3.js
* OpenStreetMap
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS

## Results
Map created with a marker on each earthquake. Size of the marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake, color corresponds to the depth.
